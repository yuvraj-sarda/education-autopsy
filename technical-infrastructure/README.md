# Technical Infrastructure

This folder contains the technical tools, workflows, and integrations that support the Education Autopsy project. It is the home for code and resources that enable data processing, AI workflows, automation, and other backend or operational systems that power our research and collaboration.

If you are adding a new technical tool or workflow that supports the project (but is not itself research content or messaging), it likely belongs in this folder.
