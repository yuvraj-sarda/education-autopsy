# Explanation of Our Platform Choice

Education Autopsy isn’t just another research project—it’s a movement to understand why education systems stay broken, and how we might build something better. To do this, we need more than just a place to store documents. We need a platform that matches our values: radical transparency, open collaboration, and adaptability as our understanding grows.

## Why Not Something Else?

We considered many options: wikis, Google Docs, Notion, even building a custom site. But each fell short in ways that matter for our mission. Most platforms hide the history of how ideas evolve, make true collaboration clunky, or lock us into proprietary systems. We needed something that would let anyone see, question, and build on our work—now and in the future.

## Why GitHub?

- **Version Control for Ideas:** Every change is tracked. Our thinking is always visible, open to challenge, and impossible to quietly rewrite. This is radical transparency in action.

- **Open Collaboration:** Anyone can propose changes, offer feedback, or start a discussion. Peer review is built in, making it easy to learn from each other and improve together.

- **Structured, Scalable Organization:** By treating our research as a codebase, we can scaffold interviews, analysis, and findings in a way that’s easy to navigate and expand as the project grows.

- **Powerful Automation:** GitHub’s workflow tools let us automate repetitive tasks—like processing interviews or updating summaries—so we can focus on deeper analysis.

- **Ecosystem Strength:** The open-source and developer community around GitHub is massive, especially for AI tools. We benefit from constant innovation and can always use the latest technology.

- **No Platform Lock-In:** Our data and history are always portable. We’re not tied to any one company’s system, ensuring the movement can outlast any single tool.

## Why AI-Native Tools Like Cursor Matter

The scale and complexity of this investigation demand more than human effort alone. AI-native tools like Cursor let us:
- **Synthesize insights across thousands of interviews and documents**—surfacing patterns no one person could see.
- **Automate analysis and formatting**—so contributors can focus on substance, not busywork.
- **Work with any AI model**—no restrictions, no lock-in, just the best tools for the job.
- **Stay at the cutting edge**—because the AI ecosystem for coding will always be ahead of any other use case. 

## The Bigger Picture

By choosing GitHub—and building on tools like Cursor—we’re creating a living, evolving investigation. Our work is open to all, powered by collective intelligence, and designed to grow as our understanding deepens. This isn’t just about fixing education. It’s about pioneering a new way to tackle complex social problems in the age of AI.
