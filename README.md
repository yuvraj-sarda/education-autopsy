# Education Autopsy: Diagnosing Why Education Systems Stay Broken
## The Problem

For decades, we've known that our education systems are broken. Students have been graduating unprepared for real life. Teachers have been burnt out. Innovation has almost stalled. Reports have piled up, but the same issues have persisted. Why have we been unable to fix this mess?

The real problem isn’t ignorance or lack of effort—it’s a lack of deep understanding. We see the symptoms, but rarely ask: what forces keep these problems in place? Every stakeholder—teachers, principals, policymakers, parents—faces constraints and incentives that outsiders rarely see. We blame individuals, but it’s the system that shapes their choices. To create real change, we need to understand these invisible forces.

## What is Education Autopsy?

**Education Autopsy is a globally-coordinated open investigation into why education systems are so broken — and how we might build something better.**

We’re not here to assign blame. We’re here to understand. By systematically interviewing stakeholders, analyzing their stories, and mapping the real constraints and incentives at play, we aim to uncover why change is so hard — and identify how reform might happen.

## How We’re Going to Make It Happen

### Widespread Collaboration
We will gather information from anyone and everyone about anything and everything related to education’s challenges. Whether you’re a student, teacher, parent, policymaker, entrepreneur, or simply a nobody — your perspective will matter. The more voices, the clearer the picture will become.

### Leveraging AI
The complexity of this problem is mind-boggling –— far beyond what any one person can synthesize. We will deal with this complexity by leveraging automated workflows and the latest generative AI models to help us integrate insights from everywhere into a cohesive picture.

### Building in Public
We will share our best findings, research, and stories openly—through posts, videos, podcasts, and every social media format we can. By building in public, we will attract more attention, feedback, and collaboration, making the investigation stronger as it unfolds.
