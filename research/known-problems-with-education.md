# Known Problems With Education Systems (Working List)

> This page is a living document. It summarises the most frequently cited pain-points that appear across interviews, research papers, and public discussions we have already gathered. It is neither exhaustive nor final—please open a pull request if you see something missing or misrepresented.

## 1. Misaligned Incentives
Schools, districts, and even entire ministries are often judged by **test scores** and **graduation rates**, not by how well students can *apply* what they learn. The result is teaching to the test, gaming metrics, and sidelining subjects that are hard to quantify (creativity, civic engagement, ethical reasoning).

## 2. One-Size-Fits-All Curriculum
Most systems group learners by **age, not mastery**. Course pacing is set to an average that serves no one: advanced students get bored; struggling students fall further behind. Personalised paths exist in pockets, but rarely scale because funding, staffing, and policy frameworks still assume uniform progression.

## 3. Teacher Burn-Out and Talent Drain
Teachers juggle lesson prep, grading, administrative paperwork, and pastoral care—often for **below-market pay**. Limited professional growth pathways and public scrutiny push many talented educators out of the classroom within the first five years.

## 4. Inequality Baked Into Funding
Where schools rely on **local taxes or fees**, wealthy areas buy smaller classes, labs, and enrichment, while poorer areas make do with outdated materials. Early gaps compound into lifelong differences in income, health, and civic voice.

## 5. Outdated Content & Skills Gaps
Curriculum revisions move on **decade-long cycles**. By the time a new subject is approved, the world has shifted again. Core literacies like AI fluency, data ethics, and climate resilience lag far behind real-world needs.

## 6. Credential Inflation Over Competence
Degrees and grades act as hiring filters even when they predict little about actual ability. This feeds a race for brand-name schools and superficial résumé padding, rather than deep skill-building.

## 7. Bureaucratic Inertia
Multiple layers of governance (school boards, districts, states, ministries) mean **everyone can veto, few can innovate**. Promising pilots die in paperwork or politics before they reach classroom scale.

## 8. Narrow Definitions of Success
Students are sorted into “academic” or “vocational” tracks early, implicitly ranking human worth by exam performance. Arts, crafts, caregiving, and community leadership are treated as side-activities instead of central pillars of a healthy society.

## 9. Mental-Health Crisis Hidden in Plain Sight
High-stakes exams, constant evaluation, and social media comparison fuel anxiety and depression. Schools seldom have the counsellor-to-student ratios or training needed to address this at scale.

## 10. Data Without Insight
Schools collect attendance, grades, and behaviour logs, but the data are siloed, inconsistent, or politically sensitive. Without trustworthy analytics, decision-makers fly blind, reinforcing status-quo policies.

**Next step:** If you recognise one of these problems in your own experience (as a student, teacher, parent, policymaker, or employer), please add a short anecdote or pointer to evidence. Real stories sharpen our understanding far more than abstract complaints.
