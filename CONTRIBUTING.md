# Contributing to Education Autopsy

## Who Can Contribute?
Anyone. Whether you are:
- A student, teacher, parent, or administrator
- A policymaker, entrepreneur, or researcher
- Someone who feels they succeeded *because* of the education system—or *despite* it
- Someone who feels let down or failed by the system
- Or simply someone with a story, question, or idea about education

Your voice and experience are valuable here.

## How You Can Contribute
- **Share your story or experience.** Every voice adds to our understanding—personal anecdotes, frustrations, successes, or questions.
- **Suggest questions, patterns, or connections.** Notice a recurring theme, contradiction, or gap? Point it out.
- **Help analyze interviews or research.** No technical skills required—curiosity and a willingness to look for patterns is enough.
- **Build tools or workflows.** If you’re technical, help us scale our analysis, automate processes, or improve collaboration.
- **Cross-reference and tag content.** Help organize and connect ideas for easier discovery.
- **Raise issues or propose solutions.** Identify problems or suggest leverage points for change.

## How to Make Changes
- **GitHub Discussions:** Start or join a conversation in the [Discussions](https://github.com/your-repo/discussions) tab to share ideas, ask questions, or propose new directions.
- **GitHub Issues:** Report problems, suggest features, or flag systemic issues using [Issues](https://github.com/your-repo/issues).
- **Clone and Edit:** Clone this repository and make your edits. We *strongly* recommend using tools like Cursor to make any edits you wish to make. This is not just easier for you (you can just ramble without having to think about where in the repository your ideas belong), but also ensures that your contributions meet the repository best practices (which Cursor already knows via the .cursor/rules directory).
- **Pull Requests:** Open a pull request for any change—big or small. We welcome improvements to research, analysis, documentation, or workflows.
- **Voice Contributions:** Prefer to talk? Call [XXX-XXX-XXXX] and share your thoughts. We’ll transcribe and integrate your input (anonymized if needed).

If you’re unsure how to start, just ask! We’re here to help. Every contribution—no matter how small—moves us closer to real understanding and change. 

## Want to Get More Involved?
We’re always looking for people who want to play a more active role in the project. If you have skills or interest in any of the following areas, we’d love to hear from you:
- **Video editing** (help us create summaries, highlight reels, or explainer videos)
- **Content creation** (write articles, synthesize research, or design infographics)
- **Content moderation** (help keep discussions constructive and respectful)
- **Software engineering** (build tools, automate workflows, or improve our platform)
- **Community building** (organize events, facilitate discussions, or grow our network)
- **Translation and accessibility** (make our content available to more people)
